 난 하늘 위를 걷네
 영원을 말해줘 just one more time
When you say that you love me
 난 그 한 마디면 돼
 변하지 않는다고 just one more time넌 내게 이 세계의 전부 같아
 더 세게 아프게 날 꽉 껴안아
우리가 나눈 something
 And you can’t make it nothing

넌 몰라도You got the best of me
 You got the best of me
So please just don’t leave me
 You got the best of me나도 나의 끝을 본 적 없지만
 그게 있다면 너지 않을까
 다정한 파도고 싶었지만
 니가 바다인 건 왜 몰랐을까
 어떡해 너의 언어로 말을 하고
 또 너의 숨을 쉬는데
 I’ll be you 날 쥐고 있는 너
 난 너의 칼에 입맞춰그러니 take my hand right now
 이런 내가 믿기지 않아
 속으로만 수천 번은 더 말했었던 그 말
 그대는 날 떠나지 마
 You got the best of me
 You got the best of me
 꿈인지 현실인지는 딱히 중요치 않지
 그저 니가 내 곁에 있다는 게
 Thanks하루하루

니가 필요해
So please just don’t leave me

 눈이 내리던 나
 모든 불행을 멈추고
 천국을 데려와
쉽게 말하지 마
 너 없는 난 없어
 넌 내 best of me
 The best of me그냥 나에 대한 확신을 줘
 그게 내가 바란 전부이니까
 우리의 규율은 없다 해도
 사랑하는 법은 존재하니까
