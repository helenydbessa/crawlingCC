눈 뜨면 뿌연 아침뿐
밤새 춤을 추며 노래해
그 끝이 없던 악보들 Ay 우린 호기롭게 shout
‘다 던져봐’
세상과 첫 싸움
Don’t wanna die
But so much pain
Too much cryin’
So 무뎌지는 칼날Oh I
We were only seven
I
But we have you all now
일곱의 겨울과 봄 뒤에
이렇게 맞잡은 손끝에
Oh I
Yeah we got to heaven내게 돌을 던져
우린 겁이 없어 anymore
We are we are together bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
또 겨울이 와도
누가 날 막아도 걸어가
We are we are forever bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)We are bullet bullet bulletproof
부정적인 시선에 맞서 우린 해냈구
나쁜 기억도 많은 시련도
다 호기롭게 우린 막아냈지 bulletproof늘 생각해
아직 꿈속인 건 아닐까
길었던 겨울
끝에 온 게 진짜 봄일까
모두 비웃던
한땐 부끄럽던 이름
이건 쇠로 된 증명
“Bullet-proof”Oh I
We were only seven
I
But we have you all now
일곱의 겨울과 봄 뒤에
이렇게 맞잡은 손끝에
Oh I
Yeah we got to heaven내게 돌을 던져
우린 겁이 없어 anymore
We are we are together bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
또 겨울이 와도
누가 날 막아도 걸어가
We are we are forever bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)Oh oh

Tell me why you don’t stop this
Tell me why you still walkin’

We are we are forever bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)(Yeah we have you have you)Yeah we are not seven, with youYeah we are not seven, with youYeah we are not seven, with youThe only thing I had was my dream
When I opened my eyes, there was only the foggy morning
Sing and dance all night long
Those music sheets that had no end Ay we shout out boldly
‘Throw it all at us’
Our first fight against the world
Don’t wanna die
But so much pain
Too much cryin’
So the blades that became dullOh I
We were only seven
I
But we have you all now
After seven winters and springs
With these fingertips that hold each other
Oh I
Yeah we got to heavenThrow stones at me
We have no fear anymore
We are we are together bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
Even if the winter comes again
No matter who blocks me, I walk forward
We are we are forever bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)We are bullet bullet bulletproof
Against the disapproving gazes, we made it
All the bad memories, the many difficulties
We boldly blocked them all out, bulletproofI always wonder
Am I perhaps still inside a dream
The long winter
Is what came at the end of it really spring
The name that everyone laughed at
That once, we were ashamed of
This is a proof made of steel
“Bullet-proof”Oh I
We were only seven
I
But we have you all now
After seven winters and springs
With these fingertips that hold each other
Oh I
Yeah we got to heavenThrow stones at me
We have no fear anymore
We are we are together bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
Even if the winter comes again
No matter who blocks me, I walk forward
We are we are forever bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)Oh oh
I won’t stop ever again
Because here, we are together
Tell me your every story
Tell me why you don’t stop this
Tell me why you still walkin’
Walkin’ with us
(Yeah we got to heaven)Throw stones at me
We have no fear anymore
We are we are together bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
Even if the winter comes again
No matter who blocks me, I walk forward
We are we are forever bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)(Yeah we have you have you)Yeah we are not seven, with youYeah we are not seven, with youYeah we are not seven, with you
