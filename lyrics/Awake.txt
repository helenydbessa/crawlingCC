 jogeum deo믿는 게 아냐
 버텨보는 거야
 할 수 있는 게
 나 이것뿐이라서머물고 싶어
 더 꿈꾸고 싶어
 그래도 말야
 떠날 때가 됐는걸Yeah it’s my truth
 It’s my truth
 온통 상처투성이겠지
 But it’s my fate
 It’s my fate
 그래도 발버둥치고 싶어Maybe I, I can never fly
 저기 저 꽃잎들처럼
 날갤 단 것처럼은 안 돼
 Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
 그래도 손 뻗고 싶어
 달려보고 싶어 조금 더이 어둠 속을 그냥 걷고 또 걷고 있어
 행복했던 시간들이 내게 물었어
 너 넌 정말 괜찮은 거냐고
 Oh no
 난 대답했어 아니 나는 너무 무서워
 그래도 여섯 송이 꽃을 손에 꼭 쥐고
 나 난 걷고 있을 뿐이라고
 Oh noBut it’s my fate
 It’s my fate
 그래도 발버둥치고 싶어Maybe I, I can never fly
 저기 저 꽃잎들처럼
 날갤 단 것처럼은 안 돼
 Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
 그래도 손 뻗고 싶어
 달려보고 싶어 조금 더Wide awake wide awake wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
No lie
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
No lieMaybe I, I can never fly
 저기 저 꽃잎들처럼
 날갤 단 것처럼은 안 돼
 Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
 그래도 손 뻗고 싶어
 달려보고 싶어
 조금 더It’s not that I believe it
But that I want to try holding out
Because this is
All that I can doI want to remain
I want to dream more
Even so, what I’m saying is
That it’s time to leaveYeah it’s my truth
It’s my truth
I will be covered with wounds all over
But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Still, I want to struggle and fightMaybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit moreI’m just walking and walking, among this darkness
My happy times asked me this question
You, are you really okay, it asked me
Oh no
I replied, no, I’m so afraid
Still, I hold the 6 flowers tightly in my hands
I, I’m just walking, I said
Oh noBut it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Still, I want to struggle and fightMaybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run, just a bit moreWide awake wide awake wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
No lie
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
No lieMaybe I, I can never fly
I can’t fly like the flower petals over there
Or as though I have wings
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Still, I want to stretch my hand out
I want to run,
Just a bit more
