For a boy with luv널 알게 된 이후 ya
내 삶은 온통 너 ya
사소한 게 사소하지 않게 만들어버린 너라는 별
하나부터 열까지 모든 게 특별하지
너의 관심사 걸음걸이 말투와
사소한 작은 습관들까지다 말하지
너무 작던 내가 영웅이 된 거라고 (oh nah)
난 말하지
운명 따윈 처음부터 내 게 아니었다고 (oh nah)
세계의 평화 (no way)
거대한 질서 (no way)
그저 널 지킬 거야 난
(Boy with luv)Listen my my baby 나는
저 하늘을 높이 날고 있어
(그때 니가 내게 줬던 두 날개로)
이제 여긴 너무 높아
난 내 눈에 널 맞추고 싶어

이제 조금은 나 알겠어Love is nothing stronger
Than a boy with luv
Love is nothing stronger
Than a boy with luv툭 까놓고 말할게
나도 모르게 힘이 들어가기도 했어
높아버린 sky, 커져버린 hall
때론 도망치게 해달라며 기도했어
But 너의 상처는 나의 상처
깨달았을 때 나 다짐했던걸
니가 준 이카루스의 날개로
태양이 아닌 너에게로
Let me fly[진/HS] Oh my my my oh my my my
[진/HS] I’ve waited all my life
[진/정국] 네 전부를 함께하고 싶어
Oh my my my oh my my my

Sometimes I prayed let me run away
But your pain is my pain
When I realized that, I vowed to myself,
With the wings of Icarus you gave me
Not toward the sun but toward you
