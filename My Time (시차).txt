My life has been a movie all the time
해 뜨는 곳으로 달렸어 every single night
누구의 내일에 가봤던 것도 같아
온 세상이 너무 컸던 그 소년
Keep on runnin’ errday mic 잡아들어
Friends ridin’ subway, I’ll be in the airplane mode
전 세계를 rock on I made my own lotto
But 너무 빠른 건지 놓쳐버린 흔적이
Don’t know what to do with
Am I livin’ this right?

Oh I can’t
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can’t call ya I can’t touch ya
Oh I can’t
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my timeOh I think I was in yesterday
Cuz everybody walk too fast
나도 모르게 커버린 어린 나
(길을 잃어버린 어린아이처럼)
This got me oh just trippin’
서성대는 이 느낌
Don’t know what to do with
Am I livin’ this right?
왜 나만 다른 시공간 속인 걸까Oh I can’t call ya I can’t hol’ ya
Oh I can’t
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can’t call ya I can’t touch ya
Oh I can’t
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my time때론 나의 숨 막힐 때면
모잘 눌러쓰고 계속 달려
Yeah I don’t gotta know where I go
Even if it’s opposite of sun
One time for the present
Two time for the past
Happy that we met each other
Now til’ the very endOh I will call ya I will hol’ ya
Oh I will
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I will call ya I will touch ya
Oh I will
And you know
Can I someday finna find my time
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Find my timeTwenty-four, it seems like I’ve become an adult faster than anyone else
My life has been a movie all the time
I ran towards where the sun would rise every single night
It even seems like I’ve been to someone’s tomorrow
The boy to whom the world seemed too big
Keep on runnin’ errday, holding the mic
Friends ridin’ subway, I’ll be in the airplane mode
The whole world rock on I made my own lotto
But is it too fast, the traces that I’ve missed out
Don’t know what to do with
Am I livin’ this right?
Am I the only one living in a different space-timeOh I can’t call ya I can’t hol’ ya
Oh I can’t
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can’t call ya I can’t touch ya
Oh I can’t
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my timeOh I think I was in yesterday
Cuz everybody walk too fast
The young me that grew up without even realising
(Like a kid who lost his way)
This got me oh just trippin’
This feeling of just hovering around
Don’t know what to do with
Am I livin’ this right
Am I the only one living in a different space-timeOh I can’t call ya I can’t hol’ ya
Oh I can’t
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can’t call ya I can’t touch ya
Oh I can’t
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my timeSometimes when I feel suffocated
I press my hat on and run
Yeah I don’t gotta know where I go
Even if it’s opposite of sun
One time for the present
Two time for the past
Happy that we met each other
Now til’ the very endOh I will call ya I will hol’ ya
Oh I will
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I will call ya I will touch ya
Oh I will
And you know
Can I someday finna find my time
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Find my time
